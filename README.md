# Redis

  This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Redis project.
  Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing data with high performance and low latency.

  ## Getting Started
    To get started with Redis, you can follow these steps:

    - Clone the repository:
    ``` shell
    git clone https://github.com/eYasarbas/Redis.git 
    ```
    - Install Redis on your machine. You can refer to the installation guide provided by Redis for detailed instructions on how to install Redis on different platforms.
    - Once Redis is installed, you can start the Redis server by running the following command:
    ```shell
    redis-server
    ```
    - You can now use Redis by connecting to the server using a Redis client library. There are several client libraries available in different programming languages. 
  ## Short description of the code 
    - ### main.py
    The provided code demonstrates the usage of the Redis Python client to interact with a Redis server. Here's a breakdown of the code:
```python
    import logging.config
    import logging
    import yaml
    import redis ```
    The necessary imports for logging, YAML parsing, and the Redis client are included.

    python
    Copy code
    with open('log.yaml', 'r') as f:
        config = yaml.safe_load(f.read())
        logging.config.dictConfig(config)
    This section reads the logging configuration from a YAML file (log.yaml) and applies it using the logging.config.dictConfig() method. This allows you to configure logging according to your preferences.

    python
    Copy code
    logger = logging.getLogger('redis')
    A logger named 'redis' is created to log messages related to the Redis operations.

    python
    Copy code
    r = redis.StrictRedis()
    An instance of the Redis client (StrictRedis) is created, connecting to the default Redis server running on the local machine.

    python
    Copy code
    r.set("view_counter", 7)
    logging.debug("Set view_counter to 7")
    The value 7 is assigned to the key "view_counter" using the set() method. A debug log message is written to indicate the operation.

    python
    Copy code
    view_count = r.get("view_counter")
    logging.debug("Get view_counter: %s", view_count)
    The value of "view_counter" is retrieved using the get() method, and a debug log message is written to display the retrieved value.

    python
    Copy code
    r.incr("view_counter")
    logging.debug("Increment view_counter")
    The value of "view_counter" is incremented by 1 using the incr() method, which increments an integer value. A debug log message is written to indicate the operation.

    python
    Copy code
    r.mset({'id': 3, 'view_count': 6, 'read_count': 1})
    logging.debug("Set multiple values: id=3, view_count=6, read_count=1")
    Multiple key-value pairs (id, view_count, read_count) are set simultaneously using the mset() method. A debug log message is written to indicate the operation.

    python
    Copy code
    key_list = r.mget(["id", "view_count", "view_counter", "key1"])
    logging.debug("Get multiple values: %s", key_list)
    The values corresponding to the specified keys (id, view_count, view_counter, key1) are retrieved using the mget() method, which returns a list of values. A debug log message is written to display the retrieved values.

    Overall, the code showcases basic Redis operations like setting values, getting values, incrementing values, and performing multiple operations in a single call. The logging statements help track the flow of operations and provide visibility into the data manipulation.
